Repository with data and scripts for the Apomixis paper. 

Version control starts on the current version of the paper, but before making the switch to the Euro+Med species names. 

``geom_facet`` branch contains an attempt to correclty plot GS and otehr discrete variables onto the phylogenetic tree using facets; parts of this development have been copy-pasted onto the ``master`` branch, however some parts have not. Merging is not practical due to parallel development of these and the main branch, kept for reference reasons. 

``master`` branch is the most current development.
